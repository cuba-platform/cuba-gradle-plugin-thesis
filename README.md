[CUBA Platform](https://www.cuba-platform.com) is a high level framework for rapid development of enterprise applications with rich web interface.

CUBA Gradle Plugin is required to build the platform and applications.

For more information see [github.com/cuba-platform/cuba](https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba-thesis).

## Build and install

In order to build the project from source, you need to install the Java 8 Development Kit (JDK).

Open terminal and run the following command to build and install the plugin into your local Maven repository (`~/.m2`):
```
    gradlew install    
```

## Development

There is no any prerequisites so just import the project as Gradle project and start working.

## Debugging

Export `GRADLE_OPTS` environment variable:
```
   export GRADLE_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005"
```

Set up `Remote` debug configuration for port 5005 in Intellij Idea.

Stop existing Gradle daemon:
```
   gradlew --stop
```

Start build of the test project with `--no-daemon` option.
